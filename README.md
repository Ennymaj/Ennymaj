## About Me ðŸš€

I am a learner of the **ALX Back-End Software Development Programme**, currently building my foundation in designing scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. Iâ€™m passionate about technology and problem-solving, which has led me to pursue a career in back-end web development. I have a keen eye for detail, strong analytical thinking, and the ability to break down complex systemsâ€”skills. My adaptability, logical reasoning, and structured approach to learning make me stand out as a fast and efficient problem-solver.
